# Object Oriented Programming \(OOP\)

In this file i will explain what the object oriented programming is and also will see how and why we use this.



Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

* OOP is faster and easier to execute
* OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
* OOP helps to keep the C\# code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
* OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time
